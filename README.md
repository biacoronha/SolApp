SolApp

This project was created using the guidance of google's codelab for Architecture Components. First, the base code was downloaded and then the steps were followed until the end.

To run and start to work on this code was necessary the following steps:
 - Update the Android Gradle plugin to version 3.2.1
 - Change "compile" to "implementation"
 - Change the support version from "26.1.0" to "26.1.0"
 - Update Build Tools and sync project
 
It's also important to note that this project uses a fake weather server for teaching reasons, however, I chose to keep it this way so that it could be shown the different possibilities of weather. (If a real one was used, the days would probably have a similar weather and it would not be possible to see the variety of descriptions and icons).
